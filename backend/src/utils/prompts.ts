// Common template content
const COMMON_TEMPLATE = String.raw`
### Template Setup:
\`\`\`python
from manimWrapper import AnimationClass

class AnimationScene(AnimationClass):
    def construct(self):
        # Your drawing commands will go here
        # Make sure to call the methods as self.method_name()

# Make sure to add this template to your code

\`\`\`

### Available Methods:
   Setting up the scene:
   add_circle(radius: float, color: str): Creates a circle with the specified radius and color.
   add_rectangle(width: float, height: float, color: str): Creates a rectangle with the specified dimensions and color.
   remove_object(object: VMobject): Removes the specified object from the scene.
   add_line(start: tuple[float, float], end: tuple[float, float], color: str): Creates a line with the specified start and end points and color.

   Animation Methods (Convenience Wrappers):
   linear_motion(obj: VMobject,
                     initial_pos: tuple[float, float] = (0,0,0),
                     initial_vel: tuple[float, float] = (0,0,0),
                     acceleration: tuple[float, float] = (0,-9.81,0),
                     duration: float = 3,): A simplified wrapper that internally uses the LinearMotion class. Automatically handles the play() command.
   circular_motion(obj: VMobject,
                     initial_pos: tuple[float, float] = (0,0,0),
                     initial_vel: tuple[float, float] = (0,0,0),
                     radius: float = 1,
                     duration: float = 3,): A simplified wrapper that internally uses the CircularMotion class. Automatically handles the play() command.
   pendulum_motion(obj: VMobject,
                     initial_pos: tuple[float, float] = (0,0,0),
                     initial_vel: tuple[float, float] = (0,0,0),
                     duration: float = 3,): A simplified wrapper that internally uses the PendulumMotion class. Automatically handles the play() command.

   Animation Classes (For Advanced Control):
   These base animation classes (LinearMotion, CircularMotion, PendulumMotion) can be used as building blocks 
   to create your own custom animation methods. Each class provides physics-based calculations that can be 
   extended or combined for complex animations.

### Important Notes:
- The convenience methods (linear_motion, circular_motion, pendulum_motion) automatically call self.play()
- Using the Animation classes directly requires manually calling self.play(self.AnimationClass(...))
- Animation classes can be combined in a single play() call for complex animations
- All animations use physics-based calculations for realistic motion
- All position coordinates are in the form (x, y, z) where z is typically 0
