   Animation Classes (For creating custom animations):



### Important Notes:
- All classes and methods need to be called with self.method_name() or self.AnimationClassName(...)
- The convenience methods (linear_motion, circular_motion, pendulum_motion) automatically call self.play()
- Using the Animation classes directly requires manually calling self.play(self.AnimationClass(...))
- Animation classes can be combined in a single play() call for complex animations
- All animations use physics-based calculations for realistic motion
- All position coordinates are in the form (x, y, z) where z is typically 0
