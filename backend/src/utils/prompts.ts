// Common template content
const COMMON_TEMPLATE = String.raw`
### Template Setup:
\`\`\`python
from manimWrapper import AnimationClass

class AnimationScene(AnimationClass):
    def construct(self):
        # Your drawing commands will go here
        # Make sure to call the methods as self.method_name()

# Make sure to add this template to your code

\`\`\`

### Available Methods:
   Setting up the scene:
        
    add_pendulum_system:
        """Add a pendulum system to the scene.
        
        Args:
            mass_radius (float): Radius of the pendulum bob
            string_length (float): Length of the pendulum string
            hinge_point (tuple[float, float, float]): Position of the pendulum's pivot point
            mass_color (str): Color of the pendulum bob
            string_color (str): Color of the pendulum string
            
        Returns:
            PendulumSystem: The created pendulum system
        """

    add_spring_mass_system:
        """Add a spring-mass system to the scene.
        
        Args:
            mass_width (float): Width of the mass block
            spring_length (float): Natural length of the spring
            anchor_point (tuple[float, float, float]): Position of the spring's fixed end
            mass_color (str): Color of the mass block
            spring_color (str): Color of the spring
            num_coils (int): Number of coils in the spring visualization
            
        Returns:
            SpringMassSystem: The created spring-mass system
        """

   Animation Methods:

   pendulum_motion:
        """Animate a pendulum system.
        
        Args:
            obj (VMobject): The pendulum system to animate
            length (float): Length of the pendulum
            initial_angle (float): Initial angle from vertical (radians)
            hinge_point (tuple[float, float, float]): Position of the pendulum's pivot point
            duration (float): Duration of the animation in seconds
        """

    spring_mass_motion:
        """Animate a spring-mass system with harmonic motion.
        
        Args:
            system (VGroup): The spring-mass system to animate
            amplitude (float): Initial displacement from equilibrium
            angular_frequency (float): Angular frequency of oscillation (rad/s)
            initial_phase (float): Initial phase of the oscillation (radians)
            damping (float): Damping coefficient (0 for undamped)
            duration (float): Duration of the animation in seconds
        """

### Important Notes:
- All methods need to be called with self.method_name()
- All animations use physics-based calculations for realistic motion
- All position coordinates are in the form (x, y, z) where z is typically 0
